Problem Statement : Identify a reasonable "chat" data set and build a simple Python application to process the data, generate an Emoji suggestion tool (using a simple sentiment analysis model of your choice) which classifies the text and returns an appropriate Emoji. The application should have a very simple interface for the user to write a message to it and receive an Emoji as output.
